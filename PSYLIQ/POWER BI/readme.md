<H1> ðŸŒŸ HR DATA ANALYSIS ðŸŒŸ</H1>
<H2> INTRODUCTION </H2>
HR Data analysis is the first task provided by PSYLIQ during my Internship. This project helped me not only to hone my skills in MS-Excel but also provided the chance to learn and have hands-on experience with PowerBi.
I was actually more comfortable with tableau, but this project required utilization of powerBi. I was able to quickly learn powerBi skills and implement it in this project.
